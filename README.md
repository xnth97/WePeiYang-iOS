WePeiYang-iOS(Deprecated)
=============
The iOS client for Tianjin University.

# Deprecated

Due to my graduation from Tianjin University, this repository is no longer maintained. The official repository is transferred to [twtstudio/WePeiYang-iOS](https://github.com/twtstudio/WePeiYang-iOS). Issue reports and pull requests here will not be attended any more.

 In the past three years, I've devoted most of my effort to this project, and now it's high time I withdrew from the project that I created three years ago. From the very beginning, the idea of WePeiYang came from several intelligent individuals as well as my closest friends. I must admit that I've learnt a lot from this project and [twtstudio](https://github.com/twtstudio), along with the people I met and worked together there.

# Acknowledgements

All fabulous people I met in Tianjin University are appreciated.
